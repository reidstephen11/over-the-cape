 * How the track is found on the day. The CREB closes in the wet and reopens about April,
 * so a June run can meet it anywhere from greasy and half-healed to dusty and hard: the
 * same track, in a different state. One is rolled from the run's seed, so a restart from
 * a camp (which keeps the seed) finds the track as it was, and `?seed=N` repeats a day.
 *
 * Everything scales off `reopened`, which is the track as the game had it before this:
 * the authored creek levels, bog depths and the storm in `crebWeather.ts` are its numbers,
 * so that roll plays exactly as v1.32 did.
