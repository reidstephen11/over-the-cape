/**
 * A 40 Series cab-chassis ute: the game's short-wheelbase 40 (the same front, cab, 4.2 L
 * petrol six and three-speed automatic) on the HJ47's 2,950 mm "super long" chassis with a
 * steel farm tray behind the single cab, built up like a Cape York farm truck: a bull bar
 * with a winch and three spotlights, a snorkel, a UHF aerial, a headboard with the high-lift
 * jack, the tarped load and the second spare on the tray. Same local frame as the 40: x
 * right, y up, z back, origin at mid-wheelbase 0.12 m above the parked hubs (the ground is
 * 0.5 m below it). The cab is the 40's cab moved forward with the front axle, so every cab
 * height is the 40's and every cab z is the 40's plus `UTE_CAB_SHIFT`.
 * Sources and the owner's look reference: reference/vehicles/landcruiser-45-ute/SOURCES.md.
